What are the advantages of django-transitions over other django workflow applications?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personally I like to have all the information about my workflow
in one place.

Are there other packages that provide this functionality?
----------------------------------------------------------

The packages I know of are (in no specific order):

    * `django-fsm <https://github.com/viewflow/django-fsm>`_
    * `viewflow <http://viewflow.io/>`_
    * `ActivFlow <https://github.com/faxad/ActivFlow>`_
    * `Django-XWorkflows <https://github.com/rbarrois/django_xworkflows>`_
    * `Django River <https://github.com/javrasya/django-river/>`_

You should evaluate if one of the above packages are a better match
for your needs.
